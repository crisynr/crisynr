## Hello! I’m Cristiane.

A Software Engineer Apprentice based in Ireland, passionate about **design (UX/UI) and front-end development** (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I’m currently expanding my skills in **back-end development** with C#, Java, and SQL.  

Offering collaboration on **website redesigns and improving mobile experiences**. I am eager to contribute to **open-source initiatives**. You can reach me [here](mailto:cristianeynr@gmail.com).  

I love bringing ideas to life through **design and technology** — from code to sewing, drawing, crafting, and interiors. When I’m not making things, I cook, pet animals, and play games — life’s too fun to stick to one thing!

### Projects on the Horizon:
 
- Searching for a beginner Java project.
- Developing web-based online booking.
- Contributing to open-source projects.

### Language and Tools:
